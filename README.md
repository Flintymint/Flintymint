## Hi there 👋
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a BSc Computing student at Islington College, currently diving deep into AI, programming, and mobile app development. I'm always looking to push the limits of what's possible with technology.

🚀 About Me
📚 I’m pursuing a BSc Hons in Computing, expecting to graduate in 2025.
💻 My tech stack includes Java, C, Flutter, .NET, and Firebase.
🌱 Currently working on a real-time tracking app for city transit, combining Flutter for the frontend and .NET for the backend with a PostgreSQL database.
🎮 I love Mobile Legends and playing as Cecilion (he’s the best!).
💡 I’m passionate about building innovative solutions and tackling complex problems through parallel computing, AI, and real-time systems.
📈 My Projects
🚎 City Transit Real-Time Tracker
A full-stack Android app for real-time public transportation tracking using Flutter (frontend), .NET (backend), Firebase, and PostgreSQL.

🖼️ Parallel Gaussian Blur Implementation
A parallel implementation of the Gaussian blur operation on bitmap images using MPI for high-performance image processing.

🧠 AI Coursework
Research and development of AI concepts, focusing on real-time data processing, problem-solving, and designing conceptual solutions with pseudocode and diagrams.

⚡ Fun Facts
I prefer working with aggressive names—I think it adds character to my projects. 😎
I’m obsessed with teal colors—it's just so calm and cool.
When I’m not coding, I’m probably playing Mobile Legends or brainstorming new tech ideas
